**Welcome!** I'm a passionate Computer Engineer, freshly minted from university and diving headfirst into the boundless world of technology. My journey in engineering is fueled by a profound interest in digital security and the robust, open-source principles of Linux. Beyond the binaries and code, I find solace and inspiration in the realms of video games, and the rich, imaginative universes of sci-fi and fantasy literature. Through this portfolio, I aim to showcase the skills and knowledge I've garnered, projects that challenge me, and the continuous quest for growth in the digital landscape.
