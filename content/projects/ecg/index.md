In this comprehensive laboratory project, we developed an ECG measuring device, focusing on enhancing the quality of ECG signals through both analog and digital filtering methods. Initially, we constructed high and low pass analog filters using specific electronic components to optimize signal clarity by eliminating unwanted frequency components. Subsequently, the processed signals were digitized using an A/D converter for further refinement in MATLAB, where we applied advanced digital filtering techniques. The project culminated in successfully achieving clearer ECG readings, which were initially noisy, demonstrating the effectiveness of our combined filtering approaches. This endeavor not only refined our practical skills but also deepened our understanding of signal processing in medical instrumentation.
