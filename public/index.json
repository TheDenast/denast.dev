Initially, we constructed high and low pass analog filters using specific electronic components to optimize signal clarity by eliminating unwanted frequency components. Subsequently, the processed signals were digitized using an A/D converter for further refinement in MATLAB, where we applied advanced digital filtering techniques. The project culminated in successfully achieving clearer ECG readings, which were initially noisy, demonstrating the effectiveness of our combined filtering approaches. This endeavor not only refined our practical skills but also deepened our understanding of signal processing in medical instrumentation.\nDownload project report ","date":"1 December 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/ecg/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"ECG Circuit with filtering","type":"projects"},{"content":"Video Preview\nI\u0026rsquo;ve completed this project back in 2021, so the code and the report may no longer be maching my current stadards.\nThis project explored the simulation of perfectly elastic collisions among various 2D shapes, focusing on aspects like shape movement, data storage, collision detection, and post-collision behavior in a 2D environment.
